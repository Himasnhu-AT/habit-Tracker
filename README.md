# Habit Tracker
This is a simple web-based habit tracker that allows you to keep track of your daily habits. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Add new habits to track


## Usage
To use the habit tracker, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can then add new habits using the input fields on the page. To mark a habit as completed or skipped for a given day, click on the corresponding cell in the calendar view. To edit or delete an existing habit, click on the "Edit" or "Delete" button next to the habit in the list.

## Technical Details
The habit tracker is built using HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. It uses JavaScript to handle the dynamic updating of the habit calendar and to save the habit data to local storage. The calendar view is generated using the Moment.js library.

## Improvements
Some possible improvements that could be made to the habit tracker include:

Adding the ability to set reminders or notifications for habits
Allowing users to track habits on a weekly or monthly basis
Creating a backend server to store habit data and allow for syncing between devices
Adding data visualization tools to help users track their progress and see trends over time
